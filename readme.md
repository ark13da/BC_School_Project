## This is my repository for completed homeworks from the school (vacational degree program in fullstack software development at Helsinki business college - started on jan 2021).


### Each folder is sandbox different concepts as the name suggests and under each category, there are a multitude of projects that was completed as school homework on that topic.

## Cloning

### The projects under the categories of 'data structures', 'React basics', 'PHP' and 'Symfony' will require installations on your local machine if you like to see what they do:

#### react apps can simply be installed by command prompt command of 'npm install'
#### The data structure projects require download and installation of MariaDB
#### the PHP and Symfony projects require installation of composer package manager

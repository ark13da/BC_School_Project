# Static app that lsist recipes 

## The recipes are fetched from an API provided at'https://api.spoonacular.com'. since a free version of the API is being used, it has daily request limit. thus, a list of some 95 recipes was fetched using PHP and was saved in a json file where the front end of the application can list recipes from.

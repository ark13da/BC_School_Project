# Recipe app
## you do not need to download the code and install it on your machine.
## instead you can find the working app at https://ark13da.github.io/
### if the recipes do not load, navigate to another route such as about and get back to recipes. it is heroku's slowness.

## the back end of the project was built with PHP/symfony
### you can find the backend repository at https://github.com/ark13da/recipe_symfony_backend

## please note at this point refreshing the page while at route such as /recipe will result in 404 error. in order to get it back to work you can remove the additional route /... and then refresh the bare bone link https://ark13da.github.io/
###  the solution for this problem is by using react hashroutes but it will be implemented later
